## DeFiYieldâ€™s Dashboard -  the Most Secure Investing Dashboard

The dashboard is the central element of the DeFiYield ecosystem. It's a unique solution combining features for effective crypto asset  management and a built in safety infrastructure allowing users to be aware of DeFi risks and handle them.

The dashboard is based on the all-in-one approach allowing users to track investment opportunities, watch performance metrics of their crypto portfolios including P&L, impermanent loss and farming rewards, relocate funds across different projects and blockchains along with being protected with the built in alerting system that informs about approvals for malicious Dapps, having backdoors, infinite minting or other security issues exposing user funds to risks. 

The dashboard is designed to be compatible with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum,  Avalanche, Solana, Polkadot and all non-EVM-compatible chains. 
 
By connecting a crypto wallet and navigating to the Dashboard section, a user gets: 
+ their account overview featuring the total balance of the wallet, the total values of funds deposited in vaults, provided in liquidity pools, lended out, staked funds and the total debt value;
+ Value of assets grouped by blockchain networks;
+ Used DeFi platforms.
